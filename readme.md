# We Rate Dogs Project

## Dataset

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account with over 4 million followers that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators are almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. This project is mainly focused on the data wrangling process of the WeRateDogs Data Analysis Project. The wrangling process was done in three stages.

## Data Wrangling

Three datasets were used for this project for this project. The first dataset (WeRateDogs Twitter archive dataset) was downloaded as available on the udacity website. The second dataset (Image prediction) which contains a table full of image prediction was downloaded programmatically using the Requests library while the third dataset which contains the numbers of likes and retweets for each tweet had to be queried from the  Twitter website using  the Twitter API. All datasets are available in this repository.


## Findings

The most popular ratings is 12 with a total count of 404 folowed by 10 with a total count of 325. The average ratings across the dataset is aprroximately 11.
